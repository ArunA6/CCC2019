## Problem J1: Winning Score

J1 was very straightforward. The input was 6 positive integers with values under 100. The 6 inputs were divided into 2 3-integer halves - eahc of which corresponded to the number of 3, 2, and 1 pointers team Apple and Banana scored, respectively. We were tasked to identify which team won, which I did by multiplying the inputted integers by the point-value fo the basket they represented (3,2,1) and then summing the 3 products for each team. The team with the greater result won.
